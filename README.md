# Dependencies
This repository is dependent on the nodejs http-parser library hosted at https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser.git  Before opening the HttpParserWrapper.sln file, clone the http-parser library into the same directory that this repo was cloned to.  So your file system should have these 3 directories:

  1. _mypath_
  3. _mypath_/http-parser
  2. _mypath_/http-parser-dotnet-wrapper
